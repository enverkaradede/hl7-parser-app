For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab.  Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result.
